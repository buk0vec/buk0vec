## Hi there 👋
### I'm Nick and I like to program all sorts of stuff

- 🔭 I’m currently working on web3 programming along with other traditional full-stack projects using React and Next.JS
- ⚙️ I also like to write nifty scripts for fun in Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about smart contracts and development for the Ethereum blockchain
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that has to do with web3 or really anything that you may find cool.
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to shoot me an email at bukovec[at]pm[dot]me
